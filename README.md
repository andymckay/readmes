Status: **draft**

This my attempt at some sort of manager README's. They are pretty basic at this point but mostly cribbed from other people with some of my own experience in there. There's some more information to come and I'm keen for feedback. If you've worked with me I'd love your feedback.

- [General about me](about-me.md)
- [First questions to ask in a 1:1](first-questions.md)
- [For people who report to me](for-reports.md)
- [For people who I report to](for-managers.md)
