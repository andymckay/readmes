I live in Vancouver, British Columbia and have done for over 20 years. I :heart: it and ain't leaving.

I love the outdoors and try to spend as much time as I can doing that. Hobbies? I've got a lot that involve the outdoors... Hiking, running (a lot), cycling (a lot), kayaking, snowboarding and curling (so Canadian). I'm happiest when I've got a bike or backpack and a long trip in front of me and no computer anywhere near by. For days on end.

My last name is pronounced Mac Eye, but I'm easy.

I think the pinnacle of engineering is a racing road bicycle. Nothing extra, easy to use, seemingly simple but amazingly sophisticated with a long engineering history. The most efficient thing for transforming donuts into transport.
