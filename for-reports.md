Congratulations and apologies for reporting to me. This is a outline of some of the things you might want to know:

* I'm British but live in Canada and have for 20+ years.
* I can quote lots of British "humour" like Monty Python and Douglas Adams. I'm sorry.
* See [about-me](https://github.com/andymckay/readmes/blob/master/about-me.md) for more.

## Communication

* Message me any time on Slack. If I'm around I'll answer. I do not have slack notifications on my phone.
* I have a strict line between work and not work. If it's urgent, text me.
* If I send you something out of hours or on a weekend I'm not expecting a reply unless I explicitly say so.
* I take vacations, you should too. When I'm on vacation I **usually** don't work at all.
* I will try and adapt to how you would like to communicate. 
* I'm introverted and prefer written communication, but understand the value of face-to-face chat. 
* Sometimes it takes me time to process things and that means I might have to get back to you.

## Principles

* Long term happiness is more important than most short term wins at the expense of peoples well being.
* I bias towards action and ownership of ideas without needing to get buy in from everyone.
* I bias towards shipping code and maybe having mistakes over being more cautions.
* The only caveat to the above is understanding the risks of what could go wrong shipping. Understanding the risk behind changes and decisions, informs our deployment speed.
* I value incremental correctness and gradually improving a solution over big bang development.
* I want to be part of a team shipping cool stuff.

## Feedback

* I tend to show my emotions visually, this can be good and bad.
* I'd like to know how you like feedback and try to follow that.
* I tend to find receiving good feedback a bit embarrasing.
* I welcome feedback that might be construed as negative, but I will admit it might take me time to process some times.

## Meetings

* I will try to circulate a clear agenda before hand.
* If relevant I want a meeting to have working notes that everyone in the meeting can collaborate on.
* I like clear purpose and action items coming out of the meeting.
* I might reject a meeting that doesn't have some of those features.
* I suggest people vote with their feet, if a meeting is not useful to you don't go.
