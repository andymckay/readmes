Congratulations and apologies for reporting to me. This is a outline of some of the things you might want to know:

* I'm British but live in Canada and have for 20+ years.
* I can quote lots of British "humour" like Monty Python and Douglas Adams. I'm sorry.

## Communication

* I have a strict line between work and not work. If it's urgent, text me. If I send you something out of hours or on a weekend I'm not expecting a reply unless I explicitly say so.
* I take vacations, you should too. When I'm on vacation I don't work at all.
* I will try and adapt to how you would like to communicate. 
* I'm introverted and prefer written communication, but understand the value of face-to-face chat. Sometimes it takes me time to process things and that means I might have to get back to you.

## Principles

* Long term happiness is more important than most short term wins at the expense of peoples sanity.
* I bias towards action and ownership of ideas without needing to get buy in from everyone.
* The only caveat to the above is understanding the risks of what could go wrong with a decision. Understanding the risk of decision helps us evaluate how critical a decision is.
* I value incremental correctness and gradually improving a solution over big bang development.
* Assume the best intent. Trust and verify.

## Feedback

This is essential to helping everyone in a team grow:
* I'd like to know how you like feedback, good and bad.
* I tend to find good feedback a bit embarrasing.
* I find I need to process feedback that might be construed as negative. I welcome it and need more of it, but admit it might take me time to process some times.

## Meetings

Let's make sure each meeting values the particpants time:
* Has a clear agenda circulated before hand.
* Has working notes that everyone in the meeting can collaborate on in the meeting.
* Clear purpose and action items coming out of the meeting.
