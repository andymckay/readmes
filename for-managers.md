Congratulations and apologies for becoming my manager. Here's some notes about managing me, I hope they help:

* I tend not to hide my feelings terribly well. This can come through in ways that I'd prefer they didn't some times. 
* I tend to over analyse and second guess myself. So when I make a mistake I can spend more time beating myself up over what happened than I should. This is the main cause of grumpiness for me.
* I tend towards being an introvert and it can sometimes take me time to process things. If you ask me what I think about a subject and I don't already know the answer, I might just need the time to process and get back to you.
* Give me something to work on and I'm on it. Point me in the right direction, give me the support I need and I'll go fix that thing or ship that product.
* Being British I can sometimes come over as not excited or enthused as others. Blame my heritage.

That's it. Thank for reading and I'm looking forward to getting to know you.
